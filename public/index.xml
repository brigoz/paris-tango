      <description>About Brigitte Born and educated in Paris, I studied ballet and piano from the age of 5. Music and dance have always been part of my life. As a child, I joined the Roland Pilain troupe performing regularly with the well known &amp;ldquo;Th√©atre du Petit Monde&amp;rdquo;. My Russian father played the violin and I grew up with the sounds of tzigane music and traditional folklore.
I fell in love with Argentine Tango, first the music then the dance, when seeing the show &amp;ldquo;Forever Tango&amp;rdquo;.</description>
